RTSP_URL=rtsp://admin:password@192.168.1.10

# ==================== DETECTION MODE ====================

# Detection Mode: adaptive (recommended) or standard
# - adaptive: Automatically switches between day and night settings based on scene brightness
# - standard: Uses single configuration for all conditions
# Recommended: adaptive for cameras with varying light conditions
# DETECTION_MODE=adaptive

# ==================== ADAPTIVE DETECTION SETTINGS ====================
# Used when DETECTION_MODE=adaptive
# Automatically adjusts sensitivity for day vs night

# Brightness Threshold (0-255 scale)
# Below this value = night mode (more sensitive)
# Above this value = day mode (more conservative)
# Typical values: 60-100 (depends on your camera and environment)
# BRIGHTNESS_THRESHOLD=80

# DAY MODE (bright scenes)
# Used when scene brightness > threshold
# Conservative settings to minimize false positives
# DAY_CONFIDENCE=0.25              # Higher confidence threshold
# DAY_MOTION_THRESHOLD=50          # Higher motion threshold
# DAY_SUSTAINED_FRAMES=3           # Standard validation

# NIGHT MODE (dark scenes / IR cameras)
# Used when scene brightness < threshold
# Sensitive settings to catch slow-moving objects
# NIGHT_CONFIDENCE=0.12            # Lower confidence (catches marginal detections)
# NIGHT_MOTION_THRESHOLD=10        # Lower motion threshold (slow movement)
# NIGHT_SUSTAINED_FRAMES=4         # Extra validation to reduce false positives

# ==================== STANDARD DETECTION SETTINGS ====================
# Used when DETECTION_MODE=standard
# Single configuration for all conditions

# Minimum confidence for YOLO detections
# Lower values (0.12-0.20): Better for IR/low-light, more false positives
# Higher values (0.25-0.40): Fewer false positives, may miss detections
# Default: 0.20 (balanced)
# MIN_CONFIDENCE=0.20

# Motion threshold in pixels
# Lower (10-30): More sensitive, catches slow movement, more false positives
# Higher (50-100): Less sensitive, requires clear movement, fewer false positives
# Default: 50 (balanced)
# MOTION_THRESHOLD=50

# Sustained frames - consecutive frames with movement required
# Lower (2-3): Faster detection, more false positives
# Higher (4-5): Slower detection, fewer false positives
# Default: 3 (balanced)
# SUSTAINED_FRAMES=3

# ==================== COMMON SETTINGS ====================

# Fallback Motion Detection (NOT RECOMMENDED)
# Uses background subtraction when YOLO doesn't detect objects
# WARNING: Causes false positives from shadows, noise, compression artifacts
# Recommended: Keep disabled
# ENABLE_FALLBACK=false
# FALLBACK_THRESHOLD=300

# Ignore Regions (timestamp/watermark filtering)
# Format: x1,y1,x2,y2 in pixels or 0.0-1.0 for percentages
# Multiple regions separated by semicolons
# Examples:
#   Bottom-left timestamp: 0,0.85,0.45,1.0
#   Bottom-right timestamp: 0.55,0.85,1.0,1.0
#   Both corners: 0,0.85,0.45,1.0;0.55,0.85,1.0,1.0
#   Disable: IGNORE_REGIONS=
# Default: Bottom-left (covers "2025-10-11 17:42:16" style timestamps)
# IGNORE_REGIONS=0,0.85,0.45,1.0
